# Stable Diffusion
 
## About this Project

The goal of this project was to research Stable Diffusion to get a better understanding of how it works. After gaining some background knowledge on Stable Diffusion, I wanted to implement the Hugging Face Stable Diffusion pipeline to illustrate how it works hands on.
 
## Dataset & Dependencies

I use the following Python/JupyterNotebook libraries in my work: 
* PyTorch for model creation
* Hugging Face diffusers to load in the Stable Diffusion pipeline

 
## Technical Approach

1. Install and load the necessary libraries
2. Define the `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` pipeline using Torch and Hugging Face diffusers
3. Create a prompt and use the pipeline to generate the image.
   
## Highlights

* Stable Diffusion
* Hugging Face
 
## Conclusion

Hugging Face makes implementing the already created `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` Stable Diffussion pipeline very straight forward.
